## Optimizing DeepSeek VL2 Performance

### Image Preparation Best Practices

1. **Resolution**: 1080p to 4K resolution works best (no need for extremely high resolution)
2. **Lighting**: Ensure good, even lighting for best results
3. **Focus**: Sharp, clear images produce better analysis
4. **Context**: Include sufficient context in the image
5. **Format**: JPEG format is recommended for most uses
6. **Size**: Keep file size under 5MB when possible

### Prompt Engineering for DeepSeek VL2

To get the best results from DeepSeek models, consider these prompting strategies:

1. **Be specific** about what aspects of the image you want analyzed
   - Good: "Analyze this foundation wall for signs of structural damage and water intrusion"
   - Less effective: "What's wrong with this wall?"

2. **Include measurement references** when relevant
   - Example: "The ceiling height is approximately 8 feet for scale reference"

3. **Mention specific technical standards** if applicable
   - Example: "Please reference IRC 2018 code standards in your analysis"

4. **For legal documentation**, specify objectivity requirements
   - Example: "Provide a factual assessment without conclusions about fault or liability"

## Troubleshooting DeepSeek Integration

### Common Error Messages

1. **Authentication Error**
   - Verify your API key is correct
   - Check that your subscription is active
   - Ensure you have Vision API access enabled

2. **Rate Limit Exceeded**
   - Wait and retry later
   - Consider upgrading your subscription plan
   - Implement request throttling in your workflow

3. **Invalid Request Format**
   - Try a different image format (JPEG is most reliable)
   - Reduce image size if it exceeds limits
   - Check for corruption in the image file

4. **Timeout Errors**
   - Check your network connection
   - Try with a smaller image file
   - Verify the DeepSeek service status

## Data Privacy Considerations

DeepSeek VL2 processes images on DeepSeek's servers. Consider these privacy aspects:

- Images are transmitted to DeepSeek for processing
- Review DeepSeek's privacy policy for data retention information
- Do not upload images containing sensitive personal information
- Consider legal and compliance requirements for your industry
- For highly sensitive work, consider enterprise deployment options

## Next Steps

After setting up DeepSeek VL2:
1. Start with test images to get familiar with the capabilities
2. Compare results between different models
3. Develop standard prompts for your common use cases
4. Create document templates that incorporate image analysis
