# System Protections in Word-GPT-Plus

Word-GPT-Plus includes various protection mechanisms to ensure reliable operation, prevent crashes, and protect against resource exhaustion. This document explains the protection systems implemented.

## Memory Protection (OOM Prevention)

Out-of-Memory (OOM) errors can cause the add-in to crash. Word-GPT-Plus implements the following protections:

### Memory Monitoring
- Continuously monitors memory usage during operation
- Automatically reduces functionality when memory usage becomes high
- Displays warnings when memory thresholds are exceeded
- Gracefully handles large documents by limiting context size

### Text Size Limitations
- Automatically applies safe size limits to text processing
- Truncates excessively large inputs and outputs
- Gradually processes large documents in chunks
- Uses streaming responses for large outputs

## Rate Limiting Protection

To prevent API abuse and ensure fair usage:

- Limits the number of requests within a time window (default: 5 requests per minute)
- Provides user feedback on remaining time before next request
- Automatically queues requests when limits are reached
- Provides clear notifications when rate limits are applied

## Input Validation & Sanitization

To ensure reliable operation and prevent potential exploits:

- Validates all user inputs before processing
- Sanitizes inputs to remove potentially harmful content
- Enforces reasonable size limits on all inputs
- Provides helpful error messages for invalid inputs

## API Request Management

To handle external service dependencies:

- Implements timeouts for all API requests (default: 2 minutes)
- Provides the ability to cancel long-running operations
- Handles network errors gracefully with informative messages
- Automatically retries failed requests with exponential backoff

## Document Size Safety

To prevent processing documents that would exceed model context limits:

- Estimates token count for document selections
- Provides warnings for large documents
- Automatically adjusts context window size based on document length
- Prevents operations that would exceed model limitations

## Error Recovery

To ensure a smooth user experience despite unexpected issues:

- Graceful degradation of functionality when resources are limited
- Comprehensive error logging for troubleshooting
- User-friendly error messages with suggested actions
- Auto-recovery from temporary failures

## How These Protections Help You

These protection mechanisms ensure that Word-GPT-Plus:

1. **Remains stable** even when processing large documents
2. **Preserves system resources** by managing memory effectively
3. **Prevents API overuse** which could result in unexpected costs
4. **Handles errors gracefully** rather than crashing
5. **Provides clear feedback** when limitations are encountered

## Best Practices

To get the best experience with Word-GPT-Plus:

1. Process moderate sections of text rather than entire large documents at once
2. Close unused applications when working with large documents
3. Allow sufficient time between complex requests
4. Save your work regularly when using AI features extensively
5. Restart Word periodically during extended editing sessions
