| Cost | Free for non-commercial use | Requires API key |
| Response Time | Fast | Variable |
| Specialized Knowledge | Strong in technical domains | Broad knowledge |

## Troubleshooting DeepSeek Integration

### Common Issues

1. **"Commercial use required" errors**
   - Solution: Enable "Non-commercial usage" or provide a valid API key

2. **Rate limit exceeded**
   - Solution: Wait and try again later, or upgrade to commercial usage

3. **Analysis timeout**
   - Solution: Try with a smaller or less complex image

4. **Low quality results**
   - Solution: Try upgrading from Base to Pro or Inspect models

### DeepSeek Error Codes

| Code | Description | Solution |
|------|-------------|----------|
| 401 | Authentication error | Check API key |
