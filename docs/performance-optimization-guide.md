# Performance Optimization Guide

## Introduction
This guide outlines best practices for optimizing the performance of Word GPT Plus. Following these guidelines will ensure a smooth user experience, even when working with large documents.

## Key Optimization Areas

### 1. API Request Optimization
- **Debounce user input**: Implement debouncing for input fields to reduce API calls
- **Cache responses**: Store recent API responses to avoid duplicate requests
- **Optimize payload size**: Only send necessary data in API requests

Learn more about API optimization on [Microsoft's REST API Guidelines](https://github.com/microsoft/api-guidelines/blob/vNext/Guidelines.md).

### 2. Rendering Performance
- **Virtualize large lists**: Use virtualization for rendering large datasets
- **Lazy load components**: Only load components when they're needed
- **Optimize React component renders**: Use React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback appropriately

### 3. Document Processing
- **Batch document updates**: Group multiple document modifications into single operations
- **Process data in chunks**: For large documents, process content in smaller chunks
- **Use Web Workers**: Offload heavy processing to background threads

Learn about Web Workers at [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers).

### 4. Memory Management
- **Clean up event listeners**: Remove event listeners when components unmount
- **Avoid memory leaks**: Be careful with closures and references
- **Monitor memory usage**: Use browser developer tools to identify memory issues

## Testing Performance
- Use [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) for performance audits
- Monitor key metrics like First Input Delay and Time to Interactive
- Test on lower-end devices to ensure broad compatibility

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Add debouncing to input fields
- [ ] Implement response caching
- [ ] Add virtualization for large lists
- [ ] Set up lazy loading for non-critical components
- [ ] Optimize expensive operations with Web Workers
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
