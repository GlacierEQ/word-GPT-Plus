# DeepSeek Pro Chrome Extension Integration

Word-GPT-Plus can integrate with the DeepSeek Pro Chrome extension to provide enhanced capabilities including code generation, web search, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and deep research.

## Features Overview

When the DeepSeek Pro Chrome extension is installed and enabled, your Word-GPT-Plus gains:

### 1. Web Search & Browsing
- Real-time access to internet information
- Integration of current facts and references into analyses
- Citation of sources when providing web-derived information

### 2. Code Generation & Execution
- Generation of code snippets to analyze image data
- Creation of algorithms for measurement, proportion analysis, etc.
- Support for multiple programming languages

### 3. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Access to relevant documentation based on image context
- Integration of technical specifications and standards
- More accurate domain-specific analysis

### 4. Deep Research Capabilities
- Ability to explore complex topics in depth
- Access to scholarly and technical sources
- Integration of high-quality reference material

## Installation

### 1. Install the DeepSeek Pro Chrome Extension:
- Visit the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/deepseek-pro/bifepkinbmimkekdmcnhlkbhmbgecfme)
- Click "Add to Chrome"
- Follow the installation prompts

### 2. Verify Installation in Word-GPT-Plus:
- Open Microsoft Word and the Word-GPT-Plus add-in
- Navigate to the Photos tab
- You should see "DeepSeek Pro Extension: Available" if the extension is properly installed and detected

## Using Enhanced Capabilities

### For Image Analysis:
1. Select a DeepSeek VL2 model in the dropdown
2. Ensure "Use DeepSeek Pro enhanced capabilities" is toggled on
3. Choose your analysis type and other settings
4. Click "Analyze Image"

### For Best Results:
- Be specific in your custom prompts about what information you need
- Reference the types of sources that would be most valuable
- Specify when you need code generation for measurements or calculations
- Include follow-up questions if the initial analysis needs more research

## Examples of Enhanced Capabilities

### Home Inspection With Code Analysis:
```
Custom prompt: "Analyze this water damage pattern on the ceiling. Calculate the approximate affected area and determine if there's a pattern that might indicate the source direction."
```

The AI might generate Python code to analyze the image pattern, calculate the affected area, and provide a technical assessment including research-
