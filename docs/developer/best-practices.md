# Word GPT Plus Development Best Practices

This document outlines the best practices for developing and maintaining the Word GPT Plus codebase.

## Code Organization

### File Structure
- Follow the established directory structure (src/core, src/api, etc.)
- Keep files focused on a single responsibility
- Limit file size - consider splitting files over 500 lines

### Component Design
- Use dependency injection where possible
- Design components with clear interfaces
- Minimize global state and side effects
- Use events for loose coupling between components

## Coding Style

### General Guidelines
- Follow consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused (< 30 lines preferred)
- Add JSDoc comments for all public methods
- Avoid magic numbers and strings - use constants

### JavaScript Best Practices
- Use ES6+ features appropriately
- Prefer const over let, avoid var
- Use async/await instead of raw promises when possible
- Destructure objects to access properties
- Use optional chaining (?.) for potentially undefined properties

## Error Handling

### Best Practices
- Use try/catch blocks around critical operations
- Implement error recovery mechanisms
- Log errors with actionable information
- Gracefully degrade functionality when errors occur
- Provide user-friendly error messages

### Error Types
- Define error categories (API, UI, System)
- Include error codes for common failures
- Track error frequency and patterns

## API Integration

### Best Practices
- Use the apiClient abstraction for all external API calls
- Implement request queuing and rate limiting
- Cache responses when appropriate
- Implement exponential backoff for retries
- Add request and response logging in development mode

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- Write tests for core business logic
- Mock external dependencies
- Test error cases and edge conditions
- Aim for high coverage of critical code paths

### Integration Tests
- Test component interactions
- Verify API integration with mocked responses
- Test end-to-end workflows

## Security

### Data Protection
- Use the security protocol for sensitive operations
- Sanitize user input
- Protect API keys and credentials
- Minimize data sent to external services

### API Security
- Validate API responses before processing
- Implement proper authentication
- Use HTTPS for all API requests

## Performance

### Optimization Techniques
- Debounce user input events
- Implement lazy loading for heavy components
- Cache expensive calculations
- Use incremental rendering for large outputs

### Resource Management
- Clean up event listeners when components are removed
- Release resources in componentWillUnmount or equivalent
- Monitor memory usage in long-running operations

## Documentation

### Code Documentation
- Document complex algorithms with comments
- Update JSDoc when changing function signatures
- Document workarounds and known issues

### User Documentation
- Keep documentation in sync with features
- Include examples for complex features
- Document configuration options

## Version Control

### Commit Practices
- Write clear commit messages
- Reference issue numbers in commits
- Keep commits focused on a single change
- Pull and rebase before pushing

### Branch Strategy
- main/master: stable production code
- develop: integration branch
- feature/*: new features
- bugfix/*: bug fixes

## User Experience

### Accessibility
- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines
- Test with screen readers
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Use appropriate ARIA attributes

### Responsiveness
- Provide feedback for long-running operations
- Implement progressive loading for large operations
- Design for different screen sizes
