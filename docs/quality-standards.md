# Word GPT Plus Quality Standards

This document outlines the quality standards and best practices for the Word GPT Plus project. Following these guidelines ensures consistent quality and maintainability across the codebase.

## Code Quality Metrics

| Metric | Target | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Test Coverage | ≥ 80% | Percentage of code covered by automated tests |
| Cyclomatic Complexity | ≤ 10 | Maximum complexity per function |
| Function Length | ≤ 50 lines | Maximum number of lines per function |
| Documentation Coverage | ≥ 90% | Percentage of public methods with documentation |
| Bundle Size | ≤ 500 KB | Maximum size of the bundled JavaScript |
| Startup Time | ≤ 1000 ms | Maximum time to initialize the add-in |
| Memory Usage | ≤ 50 MB | Maximum runtime memory consumption |
| Accessibility | WCAG AA | Web Content Accessibility Guidelines compliance level |

## Best Practices

### Code Structure

1. **Modular Design**: Use modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
2. **Single Responsibility**: Each class/function should have a single responsibility
3. **Dependency Injection**: Use dependency injection for better testability
4. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling with meaningful error messages
5. **Configuration**: Externalize configuration values

### Performance

1. **Async Operations**: Use asynchronous operations for I/O-bound tasks
2. **Lazy Loading**: Implement lazy loading for non-critical components
3. **Throttling and Debouncing**: Apply throttling for resource-intensive operations
4. **Memory Management**: Properly dispose of objects and event listeners
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Track key performance indicators

### Security

1. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
2. **Output Encoding**: Encode outputs to prevent XSS attacks
3. **Authentication**: Implement proper authentication for sensitive operations
4. **Secure Storage**: Use secure storage for sensitive data
5. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies updated to address security vulnerabilities

### Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user journeys
4. **Performance Tests**: Verify performance under different conditions
5. **Accessibility Tests**: Ensure WCAG compliance

## Quality Gates

The following quality gates must be passed before code can be merged into the main branch:

1. All tests pass
2. Code coverage meets or exceeds minimum threshold
3. No critical security vulnerabilities
4. No accessibility violations (level A and AA)
5. Performance benchmarks are met
6. Code review by at least one team member

## Continuous Quality Monitoring

Quality metrics are continuously monitored through the following tools:

1. **Unit Test Runner**: Jest for running tests
2. **Code Coverage**: Istanbul for measuring test coverage
3. **Static Analysis**: ESLint and SonarQube for static code analysis
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Custom performance tracking module
5. **Accessibility Testing**: Axe for accessibility testing
6. **Dependency Scanning**: Dependabot for security vulnerabilities

## Quality Report

A quality report is generated after each build and includes:

1. Test results and coverage metrics
2. Code quality metrics (complexity, duplication, etc.)
3. Performance benchmarks
4. Security scan results
5. Accessibility compliance status
